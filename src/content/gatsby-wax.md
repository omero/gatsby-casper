## Product Description

Wild Shake has a strong setting power but goes on smoothly to create a spiky, three-dimensional look. It adds a natural gloss to your hair and produces the moveable texture you desire. Let’s try a splashing and twirled three-dimensional style. Creating a lot of tapered hair bundles generates movement in your styling, allowing you to achieve a wild look simply and easily. Produced under the supervision of Kazuyuki Fujishiro, hair stylist (GUZZLE in Harajuku). Mild green-apple fragrance. Made in Japan. Paraben-free.

Spiky Edge is the hardest wax of the MOVING RUBBER series. Its excellent holding power keeps hair spiked and in place so you can move through your day with effortless style. Spiky Edge is designed to enhance movement even in short hair.
Produced under the supervision of Takako Kato, hair stylist (ROOTS in Shibuya)

Style Tip: Nothing says power like a high Mohawk. Create this look by applying Spiky Edge onto ends of hair and pulling hair in an upwards movement forming a straight line from forehead to the nape of the neck. Pull hair upwards in a sweeping motion by interlacing the fingers of both hands. Remember, over application of this product will result in an undesirable effect.
